# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a newly initialized project directory for a website called "tint-website". The project currently has no code implementation, framework setup, or build configuration.

## Getting Started

Before beginning development, you will need to:

1. Choose and initialize a web framework or technology stack
2. Set up the appropriate build tools and configuration
3. Initialize version control (Git)

## Current Configuration

The only existing configuration is for Claude AI permissions, allowing bash commands for file exploration (find and ls).

## Next Steps

When asked to implement the website, clarify:
- Preferred technology stack (React, Vue, Next.js, plain HTML/CSS/JS, etc.)
- Project requirements and features
- Deployment target (static hosting, server deployment, etc.)
